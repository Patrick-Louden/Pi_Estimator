piEstimator is a python script which can estimate the value of (pi) by generating random number pairs (as x-y coordinates) within [0,1], and the generated pair is tested to see if it falls within a unit circle.

The number of points that fall within the circle divided by the total number of attempts made, can be related to the value of (pi). This is done by a ratio of the area of the circle and the area of the square.
